    <h2>History</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra discovered the area during 1461.

The 300 foot tall Cape Mount became the landmark for settlers in the region. Theodore Canot formed the settlement in 1840.<br>

In 1847, Liberia became independent with three counties: Montserrado, Grand Bassa and Sinoe. A local government was formed after signing a treaty with <br>the locals in 1849, while Robertsport was established in 1856. The area now known as Grand Cape Mount became the territory of Grand Cape Mount under Montserrado County.<br>

In 1856, Cape Mount was carved out of Montserrado by a legislative act and became the fifth County in Liberia.[3][4] The superintendent is Aaron Vincent.
