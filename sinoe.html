    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Long settled by indigenous peoples, this area became colonized by more than 300 freed African-American slaves from Prospect Hill Plantation, <br>Mississippi in 1835. The colony was originally called Mississippi-in-Africa, under auspices of a chapter of the American Colonization Society.<br> Greenville was named after Judge James Green and was established with the freed Black Americans of the society in 1838.<br> Green was instrumental in bringing a group of slaves from the Mississippi Delta to Liberia.<br> The town was a prominent exporter of rubber, lumber and agricultural products. <br>It was destroyed during the First Liberian Civil War but has been rebuilt. <br>There is boat connectivity from the town to Monrovia and Harper.
