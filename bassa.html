    <h2>History</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The port of Buchanan was constructed by LAMCO to serve the export of iron ore carried through the railway from Nimba.<br>The civil war destroyed the port, railway and the township built by LAMCO. In 2005, LAMCO's facilities were taken over by Arcelor-Mittal, which has begun a gradual reconstruction. <br>The once bustling port became a ghost town, until the arrival of Arcelor-Mittal and the consequent prospects of employment. <br>Under terms of a 2005 agreement with the national government, Arcelor-Mittal will give $1 million each year to the county for iron ore exploitation, though these terms were revised in 2007.
