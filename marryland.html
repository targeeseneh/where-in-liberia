    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Maryland was first established as a colony of the Maryland State Colonization Society in 1834, but was not granted independence until 1854.<br> The Maryland Society had played a pivotal role on the formation of the larger American Colonization Society years before. <br>Following a referendum in 1853, the colony declared its independence from the Colonization Society across the Atlantic Ocean and formed the Republic of Maryland. <br>It held the land along the south coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers.<br><br>

In 1856, the Republic of Maryland requested military aid from nearby Liberia in a war with the Grebo and Kru peoples who were resisting the Maryland settlers' efforts to control their trade in slaves.<br> Liberian President Joseph Jenkins Roberts assisted the Marylanders, and a joint military campaign resulted in victory. <br>Following a referendum in February 1857 the Republic of Maryland joined Liberia as Maryland County on 6 April 1857.<br> As of May 2004, a DRC census estimated the county's population to be 107,100.<br>

During the 1970s, Maryland County was terrorized by ritual killings. The crimes have been regarded as "Liberia's most notorious ritual killing case" due to the number of murders, <br>the involvement of high ranking government officials and their subsequent public executions.
